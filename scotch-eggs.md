# Scotch Eggs

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs (extra for potential mishaps)
- 1 egg (beaten, for breadcrumbing)
- breadcrumbs (panko?)
- mustard powder
- thyme
- parsley
- 1 spring onion
- cayenne pepper
- all-purpose flour
- 400g minced pork
- vegetable oil (for frying)

## Method

1.  Put cold eggs in boiling water, and reduce heat to medium-high. Cook ~6
    minutes
2.  Remove eggs and put into cold water (crack slightly to make peeling easier)
3.  Peel eggs and dry on paper towel
4.  Finely chop spring onion
5.  Mix sausage, spring onion, and herbs. Shape into equal balls (same number of
    balls as eggs)
6.  Lay a piece of plastic wrap out and put ball in middle. Squash to about 4mm.
    Moisten fingers and put egg in middle and gently press sausage around the
    egg, completely sealing. Repeat for all eggs
7.  Set up pan√© station (3 trays: flour, beaten egg, breadcrumbs). Dredge in
    flour, dip in beaten egg, then press in bread crumbs to coat. Gently toss
    between hands to remove excess breadcrumbs. Set aside.
8.  Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pan to 175C.
9.  Cook eggs in batches until golden, about 5-6 minutes, turning frequently if
    oil is not deep enough to cover.
10. Transfer to wire rack to cool, for about 5 minutes.
