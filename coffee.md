# Coffee

Each factor below generally varies based on which method you are using to brew your coffee. Assume that every factor interacts with every other factor, so you're better keeping as much as possible the same and only tweaking one factor at a time.

-   **Under-extracted coffee** generally has taken less than the ideal mass of solids from the coffee. These will taste sharp, sour, and wine-dry.
-   **Over-extracted coffee** will taste harsh, bitter, and astringent.

## Grind Size

-   Smaller grinds shorten the time for ideal extraction
    -   each piece can fully soak easier
-   Larger grinds taken longer to fully extract
-   More coffee implies more material to extract, so you'll get stronger coffee for a given amount of time.
    -   More coffee will also restrict the flow, so it's not quite a linear reaction

## Water Temperature

-   Hotter water softens the cellulose of the grind, so will take less time to fully saturate than using cold (for a given grind size)
-   You need $>184F$ to fully extract all compounds
-   Generally there has been no proof that water can be too hot. Tune it to your own coffee.

## Pressure

-   High pressure results in faster extraction.
    -   e.g. espresso takes $30$ to $35s$ at $9bar$, whilst Aeropress takes far more water and more time.
-   *"If you need to press hard to hurry things up, you're probably going to overextract."*

## Agitation

-   More agitation results in faster brewing, as you're ensuring the water can soak the particles.
-   Not agitating your coffee can result in an uneven or 'dilute' brew.

## Balancing Settings

Tuning temperature is *very volatile*, so it's best to keep temperature constant whilst tweaking other variables. **Grind** is often the best single variable to change while controlling everything else.

*Technique* is only really worth tuning if you're near optimal and want that little bit extra.

## Water volume

-   More water → longer brew
-   More water → faster extraction and flow rates
-   In most cases, more water → weaker coffee.
-   Adding water to *strong* coffee doesn't negatively affect the taste compared to just brewing with more water.

## Bloom

-   There's no real consensus on whether bloom makes a difference.

## Filter Rinsing

-   Filter rinsing is mostly bullshit.

## Why not just ultra-fine, with a lot of water?

*"Why not just use espresso grind in an Aeropress, but with a very fast brew, to get an even extraction across a narrow window."*

-   **Most consumer grinders are not great at *very fine* or *very coarse*,** so you probably need to deal with brewing somewhere in the middle.
-   The shorter your extraction window, the tighter your margins of error (so much less forgiving)
