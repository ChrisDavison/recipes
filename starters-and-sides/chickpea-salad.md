# Chickpea Salad

Bit too much chilli in it, and the salad was generally a bit bland. Sauce was
enjoyable, but the flavours of chickpea, feta, spinach, and dressing just felt a
bit disparate.

Ingredients

-   1 can chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
-   handful of spinach
-   3.5oz feta cheese (100g)
-   1/2 tbsp lemon juice
-   3 tsp honey
-   4 tbsp olive oil
-   0.5tsp cumin (ground)
-   1 pinch salt
-   1/2 tsp chilli flakes (or dried cayenne)
