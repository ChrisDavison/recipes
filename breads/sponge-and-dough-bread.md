Ingredients

Sponge

-   120g bread flour
-   1g salt
-   6g sugar
-   1g instant dry yeast
-   95g water

Dough

-   180g bread flour
-   3g salt
-   12g powdered milk
-   25g honey
-   3g instant dry yeast
-   90g water
-   35g unsalted butter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method

Sponge

-   mix flour, salt, sugar, and yeast (don't pour yeast directly on top of salt
    as salt may kill it)
-   mix in 95g lukewarm water
-   mix until all powder collected
-   cover and rest in a warm place until \~2x size

Dough

1.  add yeast to 90g lukewarm water and mix
2.  add other ingredients onto sponge, adding yeast mixture at end
3.  mix everything
4.  put onto bench and knead for about 10 minutes (unil everything mixed
    thoroughly)
5.  add butter and knead until fully integrated and and so a 'film' forms when
    stretched
6.  form into a tight ball
7.  rest in a bowl again until \~2/2.5x size - if you can poke a finger in and
    the dough doesn't rebound, it's risen well
8.  take out the dough and divide into two equal parts
9.  roll into firm balls and rest for 15 minutes (under towel or film)
10. roll out
11. flip over
12. fold 2 edges inward (to width of bread pan)
13. roll up and place both in the breadpan
14. rest again until rises
15. bake at 190C for \~20 minutes
