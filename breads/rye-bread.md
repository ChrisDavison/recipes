Method (pre-ferment)

*Make pre-ferment*

1.  Mix 250g rye flour and 0.5g dry yeast in something like a kilner jar. Add water and give it a good mix.
2.  Cover, and leave to sit overnight at room temperature. \~12 hours.

*Make dough*

1.  Check that the mix is full of bubbles (shows yeast has worked).
2.  Add warmish water to large bowl, and mix in yeast. Add a large tbsp of black treacle to mix and melt into the water.
3.  Add salt, and stir to dissolve.
4.  Add pre-ferment. Mix as well as possible.
5.  Add toasted seeds and incorporate.
6.  Add flour and mix well.
7.  Sprinkle a load of flour on your worktop. Dump the dough out and loosely shape into a loaf. Leave it to rest in the banneton/bread basket.

*Proving and baking*

1.  About 1 hour into proving, turn on oven at 200C, with dutch oven inside.
2.  After 2 hours of proving, put the bread in the dutch oven, and do a \~1/2 inch cut down the length of the top. Bake for 30 minutes.
3.  Take the lid off, and then bake for maybe another 30 minutes.
