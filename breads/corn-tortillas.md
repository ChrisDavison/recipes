# Corn Tortillas

6 to 8 tortillas

## Ingredients

-   1 cup corn masa flour (Maseca / masa harena)
-   hot tap water
-   salt
-   plastic sheets / parchment paper

`*` you can cut a ziplock along the 2 sides and beneath the zip to get a 'book', instead of using parchment, and use this to prevent the dough sticking to the tortilla press.

If you don't have a tortilla press, just use a large, flat-bottomed pan to press the tortillas.

## Method

1.  Put corn flour and salt in a bowl. Mix.
2.  Add 1 to 1.5 cups of water per cup of corn flour.
3.  Knead the dough. If the dough is a bit powdery, add some more water.
    a.  Want it roughly the texture of playdough.
4.  REST with dish towel over the top for 20 minutes
5.  Cut the dough into 8 portions, and roll into balls

Then, to cook

1.  Press a ball in between 2 sheets of plastic/parchment.
2.  Peal from the plastic and put on a HOT griddle.
3.  Cook on 1 side for about 30 seconds, till edges slightly translucent.
4.  Flip, and cook for about 1 minute. When it starts to bubble, and the other side looks done, flip.
5.  Press a little bit in the middle, and let the tortilla puff up.
6.  Cook for another about 10 seconds to get completely cooked through.
7.  Put into a container with a dish towel, and cover, to keep warm and flexible.
8.  REPEAT
