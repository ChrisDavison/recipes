# Ingredients

-   2 tortillas
-   1/3 cup cooked bake beans, with sauce
-   1oz grated cheese (monterey jack, cheddar, or mixed)
-   salsa for serving

# Method

-   Place corn tortilla on a plate. Top with beans, and lightly mash beans with back of a spoon. Sprinkle on cheese and top with remaining tortilla.
-   Press down gently
-   Microwave for 1 to 1.5 min till cheese melted

ALTERNATIVELY, if you want to pan cook, do the same as above but in a pan. After placing ingredients in, turn the heat to medium-high, and don't add the second tortilla till the cheese begins to melt. Press down lightly, flip the quesedilla, and heat for about 30 seconds.

Serve.
