# Quinoa Peanut Butter Crunch Cups

Makes \~12 cups, approx 100-150cal per cup

DIDN'T WORK. Don't know if it needed smooth peanut butter or what, but it came
out very brittle. Also, not really a fantastic taste (again, 100% peanut butter,
so not very sweet?). Used purely coconut oil, rather than butter, so maybe more
oily and less buttery tasting than it should.

Ingredients

-   1.5 cups puffed quinoa
-   1/4 cup and 2 Tbsp peanut butter
-   1/4 cup and 2 Tbsp coconut butter
-   2 Tbsp coconut oil
-   1.5 Tbsp maple syrup
-   1 tsp vanilla extract

Method

Pop quinoa

-   Put pan on medium heat, and wait till hot.
-   Pour a small amount of quinoa and swirl with a wooden spoon as it pops, to
    help stop it burn
-   After it pops, transfer to another bowl, and repeat with the next load of
    quinoa

Then...

-   In a saucepan over low heat, combine peanut butter, coconut, maple syrup,
    and vanilla.
-   Stir until completely smooth
-   Turn off the stove
-   Mix quinoa into the peanut mix
-   Scoop 2 tablespoons into each muffin liner and smooth with a smooth
-   Place muffin tin in the freezer for 1 hour to set
-   Once cups have set, they can be stored in the fridge
