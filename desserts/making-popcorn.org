* Making Popcorn
@recipe @dessert

** Ingredients

- 1/3 cup kernels
- 2 tbsp Coconut oil

** Method

1. Melt coconut oil
2. Place 4 kernels into oil
3. When kernels pop, put rest of kernels in an even layer, and take off the heat. After 30 seconds, put back on the heat. (this gives time for all the kernels to get to an even temperature)
4. Gently shake/move kernels while popping. Put lid at an angle to let steam out (crispier popcorn)
5. When pooping gets to 2/3 between, take the kernels out

Flavouring

1. Melt some butter and sugar in a pan
2. Pour over the pre-made popcorn
