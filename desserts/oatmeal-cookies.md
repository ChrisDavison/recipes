Method

1.  Preheat oven to 350F (180C)
2.  Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
3.  In separate bowl, whisk coconut oil/butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk vigorously.
4.  Stir wet ingredients into the dry.
5.  Stir in oats, raisins (and walnuts, if using), into a tihgt batter.
6.  Let rest for 20 minutes (potentially in the fridge, if the dough isn't 'scoopable'). If it's too crumbly, stir in 2-3 tbsp water.
7.  Scoop into 20 tbsp-sized balls, and roll lightly in barely damp hands to make them round
8.  Spread onto baking sheet, and bake until puffed, golden, and a touch *underbaked*-looking (10-11 minutes)
9.  Let cool on the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
