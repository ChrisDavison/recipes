@recipe @dessert

** Ingredients

- 397g can carnation condensed milk
- 150ml carton double cream
- finely grated zest and juice of 4 large unwaxed lemons (about 150ml)
- 1tbsp chopped mint leaves
- 1tsp granulated sugar
- squeeze of lemon juice

** Method

1. whisk the condensed milk and cream together until thick and very light; 4 or 5 minutes.
2. add the lemon juice and zest and whip for a few seconds only as the mixture will thicken very quickly.
3. spoon the lemon cream into ramekins, or a large trifle bowl and then chill for at least an hour, or overnight.
4. to serve, muddle the mint leaves with the sugar and lemon juice and sprinkle a little onto the lemon cream.

Most creamy mousses need some sort of setting agent, gelatine being the most popular. here, the reaction between the acid from the fruit, the condensed milk and the cream, make a great setting combination.

**Tip:* serve this with fresh raspberries and home made shortbread biscuit
