* Peanut-Butter Protein Bar
@recipe @dessert

Cooks about 8 bars. Prep time about 10 minutes, but best to sit in fridge for 1 hour, or even 24.

** Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (~113g) Peanut Butter
- 1/2 cup (~60g) oat flour
- 1/2 cup (~150g) honey
- 2 scoops protein powder
- 2 sheets wax paper

...these measures give about 1400 cal, => 8x 200cal bars

** Method

- MIX (may need to use hands to combine)
- Leave in fridge for 1hr for chewy texture
- Leave in fridge for ~24hr for more solid texture

(may need to eat these out of fridge, rather than leaving on the counter)
