# Everyday Wholewheat Sandwich Bread

***I made this with 1.5x as much, as the flour amount seemed low, but it
ballooned like hell due to the amount of yeast.*** Updated the recipe back to
the *actual* given measurements.

- 225g wholewheat flour
- 150g plain flour
- 8g salt
- 6g instant yeast
- 285g warm milk (~110F 44C)
- 42g honey
- 28g butter (warm)

***Method***

1.  Mix all the dry ingredients
2.  Add wet ingredients and mix.
3.  `15min to 30min` -- rest dough (autolyse)
4.  knead (when it starts to tear a little, it's had enough) ... will probably
    be quite tacky
5.  `1h30 to 2h` -- rest
6.  shape -- lay horizontal. 'book fold' the sides in and pat to seal; then roll
    from the top, pushing in to seal after each roll/fold
7.  `optional` -- coat the top with seeds or something -- put a damp kitchen
    towel in one pan, and put the topping in another pan. roll the top of the
    bread in the damp towel, then into the topping.
8.  butter your bread pan, and put the loaf in.
9.  `1h30 to 2h` -- rest in a warm place. should bounce back *just a little* if
    you press with your finger. pre-heat oven near the end of the prooving time
    (~350F 180C)
10. bake for ***35-40 minutes***
