    be quite tacky
5.  `1h30 to 2h` -- rest
6.  shape -- lay horizonal. 'book fold' the sides in and pat to seal; then roll
    from the top, pushing in to seal after each roll/fold
7.  `optional` -- coat the top with seeds or something -- put a damp kitchen
    towel in one pan, and put the topping in another pan. roll the top of the
    bread in the damp towel, then into the topping.
8.  butter your bread pan, and put the loaf in.
9.  `1h30 to 2h` -- rest in a warm place. should bounce back *just a little* if
    you press with your finger. pre-heat oven near the end of the prooving time
    (~350F 180C)
