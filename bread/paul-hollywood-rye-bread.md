# Paul Hollywood's Rye Bread

Ingredients

- 500g rye flour
- 10g salt
- 10g instant yeast
- 20ml black treacle
- 350ml cool water
- olive oil, for kneading

If using a seed soaker, do the soaker \~12 hours before. For however much soaker, do equal parts seeds/grains and water.

***2022-05-05*** DO NOT put in ~equal amounts of seeds. I made with 170g pumpkin, 330g sunflower seed soaker, and it had a bit of a 'weird' taste.

Method

1. Put flour in a bowl. Add yeast to one side, and salt to the other. Mix.
2. Add treacle and 3/4 of the water and mix.
3. Continue to add the remaining water, a little at a time, till all the flour is picked up. *You may not need all the water. You may need more.*
4. Coat a clean work surface with a little olive oil. Tip the dough out and knead for 5-10 minutes, until the dough starts to form a soft skin.
5. Form the dough into a smooth round cob shape. Put into a floured banneton and cover with a tea towel
6. Rest overnight (or at least 8 hours). It'll double in size eventually.
7. Preheat oven to 220C, with roasting tray in the bottom.
8. When the tray is hot, half-fill with boiling water (for steam, for a better crust).
9. When the loaf is risen, invert it onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
10. Cut the top slightly (whatever pattern you prefer) to provide a 'break point'.
11. Bake for 30 minutes. Tap the bottom to check it sounds hollow.
12. Remove from oven to cool.
